## My Budget App

### Description
For almost 30 years, when keeping track of my personal finances, I have used a homemade Excel spreadsheet that I created when I first got married. The way it was set up was with two different sides; the left side is a breakdown of incoming and outgoing funds, broken down into budget categories, and the right side is a classic check register. Entries would be made in the check register, and then would be added to the left side in the appropriate category. What made this tool effective for me was that the two sides had to balance, so if they didn't match, then I knew something had been entered wrong. 

Each workbook contains info for one calendar year, and there is one sheet for each month. There are formuls and links between each sheet, so that one month just carries over to the next month.

### Upgrading to web app
I have been working with web technology for over 20 years, and have worked with multiple different stacks, starting with the classinc LAMP stack, and adding the Javscript frameworks as they became more and more prevalent. After years of playing with various tools, I have finally settled on a toolset for data heavy web apps that I enjoy working with, and that make my development work easier:

- [Laravel](https://laravel.coo)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
- [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Laravel has a distribution called [Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) which nicely encapsulates this stack for you right out of the box.

And, as all devs have side projects, I decided that the technology was finally here that would allow me to move on from my Excel spreadsheet. Yes, I am aware that there are many other personal finance apps out there, but a) I haven't seen one that works like I want it to work, and b) I want to make my own and learn something in the process.

## The Plan
Eventually, I think it would be fun to make this a subscription web app, where you could sign up and have your own instance of the app for managing your finances. For now, I'm just working on it locally, and as it moves along, I will eventually deploy it.
